If you want the replit version
https://replit.com/@FabianDream/easymc-minecraft-bot

The replit version asks you 
first to input the ip address of the server 
then the token of the account (from "(https://easymc.io/get)https://easymc.io/get"
then after the messages might look weird if they contain colour but anything you type in the terminal your bot will say.
